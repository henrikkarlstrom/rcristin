# rcristin

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rcristin is to get results from the Norwegian academic publication
  database Cristin and return them as a data frame formatted according to analysis
  parameters provided.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("henrikkarlstrom/rcristin")
```
## Example

A simple query for academic publications from a unit, which is stored as a data frame:

```{r example}
library(rcristin)
## get Cristin results from NTNU's University Library
ntnuub <- get_cristin_results(unit = "194.14.30.0", published_since = 2015)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
